Todo list:

Use some sort of templating system to generate the various Makefiles,
botan-config, and so forth.

Get rid of mkconfig.pl; simply read the system info files when the
user runs configure.

Clean out all of the crappy hacks that have crept into to the source tree, move
them out into the appropriate file in the 'os' and 'cc' directories. I got rid
of a lot of them in 1.4.[23], but some remain.
