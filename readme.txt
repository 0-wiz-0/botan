Please note that this is an experimental / development version of
Botan. Feedback and critical analysis is highly appreciated. There may
be bugs (as always). If this sounds scary, it's recommended you use
the latest stable (1.6) release.

You can file bugs at http://www.randombit.net/bugzilla

For more information, see info.txt, the API manual, and the tutorial,
all of which can be found in the doc/ directory.
