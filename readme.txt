Botan 1.7.11 (pre)
http://botan.randombit.net/

Please note that this is an experimental / development version of
Botan. Feedback and critical analysis is highly appreciated. There may
be bugs (as always). APIs may be changed with little or no notice. If
this sounds scary, it's recommended you use the latest stable release
instead.

You can file bugs at http://www.randombit.net/bugzilla or by sending
mail to the botan-devel mailing list.

For more information, see info.txt, the API manual, and the tutorial,
all of which can be found in the doc/ directory.
