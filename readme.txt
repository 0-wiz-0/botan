Botan 1.7.24-pre ????-??-??
http://botan.randombit.net/

This release of Botan is the third release candidate for the 1.8.0
release. It should be stable, though some APIs have changed
incompatibly since the 1.6 release.

You can file bugs at http://www.randombit.net/bugzilla or by sending
mail to the botan-devel mailing list.

For more information, see info.txt, the build instructions, the API
reference manual, and the tutorial, all of which can be found in the
doc/ directory.
