Botan 1.7.24-pre ????-??-??
http://botan.randombit.net/

This is the first release of the new Botan 1.8 release series. We
consider it the best version of Botan available, and recommend all
users upgrade as soon as possible. Some APIs have changed incompatibly
since the 1.6 release series.

You can file bugs at http://www.randombit.net/bugzilla or by sending
mail to the botan-devel mailing list.

For more information, see info.txt, the build instructions, the API
reference manual, and the tutorial, all of which can be found in the
doc/ directory.
