Botan 1.7.1

Please note that this is an experimental / development version of
Botan.  Don't be surprised by bugs. No, the documentation hasn't been
updated (yet). Feedback and critical analysis is highly
appreciated. If this sounds scary, it's recommended you use the latest
stable release (either 1.4.x or, preferably, 1.6.x).
