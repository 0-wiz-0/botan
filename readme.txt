Botan 1.7.24 2008-12-01
http://botan.randombit.net/

Botan is a C++ class library for performing a wide variety of
cryptographic operations.

This is the third release candidate for Botan 1.8.0. I consider it the
best version of Botan available, and recommend all users upgrade from
1.6 or earlier versions as soon as possible. Some APIs have changed
incompatibly since the 1.6 release series, but most applications
should work as-is or with only simple modifications.

Botan is licensed under a BSD-like license, the terms of which are
specified in 'doc/license.txt'. More information about the authors and
contributors can be found in 'doc/credits.txt' and 'doc/thanks.txt'

You can file bugs in Bugzilla, which can be accessed at
  http://www.randombit.net/bugzilla/
or by sending a report to the botan-devel mailing list
  http://lists.randombit.net/mailman/listinfo/botan-devel/

In the doc directory, there should be a set of PDFs, including

building.pdf - Build instructions
api.pdf - API reference manual
tutorial.pdf - A set of simple examples and tutorials

Other examples can be found in the doc/examples directory.

Some higher level protocols are implemented on top of Botan by:

NetSieben SSH Library (SSHv2): http://www.netsieben.com/products/ssh/
Ajisai (SSLv3/TLSv1): http://www.randombit.net/code/ajisai/
