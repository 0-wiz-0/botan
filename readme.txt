This is Botan 1.6.0, the first stable release of the new Botan
API. This release is mostly compatible with Botan 1.4.x, and many
applications written against 1.4.x will work against 1.6.0 without any
modifications. However some applications, particularly ones doing
complex processing, will require changes to match the new API.
