Botan 1.7.3 (prerelease)

Please note that this is an experimental / development version of
Botan.  Don't be surprised by bugs. No, the documentation hasn't been
updated (yet). Feedback and critical analysis is highly
appreciated. If this sounds scary, it's recommended you use the latest
stable release (either 1.4.x or, preferably, 1.6.x).

You can file bugs at http://www.randombit.net/bugzilla

For more information, see info.txt, the API manual, and the tutorial,
all of which can be found in the doc/ directory.
