Botan 1.7.24-pre ????-??-??
http://botan.randombit.net/

This is the third release candidate of Botan 1.8.0. We consider it the
best version of Botan available, and recommend all users upgrade from
1.6 or earlier versions as soon as possible. Some APIs have changed
incompatibly since the 1.6 release series, but most applications
should work as-is or with only simple modifications.

You can file bugs in Bugzilla (http://www.randombit.net/bugzilla) or
by sending a report to the botan-devel mailing list
(http://lists.randombit.net/mailman/listinfo/botan-devel)

For more information, see info.txt, the build instructions, the API
reference manual, and the tutorial, all of which can be found in the
doc/ directory.
