Botan is a C++ class library for performing a wide variety of
cryptographic operations. It includes support for the following
algorithms and formats:

Public Key Algorithms
  * Encryption algorithms RSA, ElGamal, DLIES
       (padding schemes OAEP, PKCS #1 v1.5)
  * Signature algorithms RSA, DSA, ECDSA, Nyberg-Rueppel, Rabin-Williams
       (padding schemes PSS, PKCS #1 v1.5, X9.31)
  * Key agreement techniques Diffie-Hellman and ECKAEG (ECDH)

Ciphers
  * Block cipher modes ECB, CBC, CBC/CTS, CFB, OFB, and CTR,
       and authenticated cipher mode EAX
  * AES (Rijndael) and AES candidates Serpent, Twofish, MARS, CAST-256, RC6
  * DES, and variants 3DES and DESX
  * Stream ciphers ARC4, Salsa20, Turing, and WiderWake4+1
  * National/telecom block ciphers SEED, KASUMI, MISTY1, GOST, and Skipjack
  * Other block ciphers including Blowfish, CAST-128, IDEA, Noekeon,
       TEA, XTEA, RC2, RC5, SAFER-SK, and Square
  * Block cipher constructions Luby-Rackoff and Lion

Hash Functions and MACs
  * Authentication codes HMAC, CMAC (aka OMAC1), CBC-MAC, ANSI X9.19 DES-MAC,
       and the protocol-specific SSLv3 authentication code
  * Secure hashes SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, Whirlpool
  * Transition hashes SHA-1, Tiger, RIPEMD-160, RIPEMD-128, HAS-160, FORK-256
  * Obsolete/broken hashes MD2, MD4, MD5
  * Checksums Adler32, CRC24, CRC32

Certificates
  * X.509 certificates (including generating new self-signed and CA certs)
  * X.509 CRLs
  * PKCS #10 certificate requests
  * Card Verifiable Certificates (used in ePassports)

PBKDFs, KDFs, and PRFs
  * PBKDF1 from PKCS #5 v1.5
  * PBKDF2 from PKCS #5 v2.0
  * OpenPGP S2K (string to key) from RFC 2440
  * KDF1 and KDF2 from IEEE 1363
  * PRFs from ANSI X9.42, SSL v3.0, TLS v1.0
