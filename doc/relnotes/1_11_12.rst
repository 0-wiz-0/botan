Version 1.11.12, 2015-01-02
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Add Curve25519. The implementation is based on curve25519-donna-c64.c
  by Adam Langley. New (completely non-standard) OIDs and formats for
  encrypting Curve25519 keys under PKCS #8 and including them in
  certificates and CRLs have been defined.

* Add Poly1305, based on the implementation poly1305-donna by Andrew Moon.

* Add the ChaCha20Poly1305 AEADs defined in draft-irtf-cfrg-chacha20-poly1305-03
  and draft-agl-tls-chacha20poly1305-04.

* Add ChaCha20Poly1305 ciphersuites for TLS compatible with Google's servers
  following draft-agl-tls-chacha20poly1305-04

* When encrypted as PKCS #8 structures, Curve25519 and McEliece
  private keys default to using AES-256/GCM instead of AES-256/CBC

* Define OIDs for OCB mode with AES, Serpent and Twofish.
