Version 1.8.14, 2012-07-18
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The malloc allocator would return null instead of throwing in the
  event of an allocation failure, which could cause an application
  crash due to null pointer dereference where normally an exception
  would occur.

* Recent versions of OpenSSL include extra information in ECC private
  keys, the presence of which caused an exception when such a key was
  loaded by botan. The decoding of ECC private keys has been changed to
  ignore these fields if they are set.

* AutoSeeded_RNG has been changed to prefer ``/dev/random`` over
  ``/dev/urandom``

* Fix detection of s390x (Debian bug 638347)
