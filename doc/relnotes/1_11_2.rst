Version 1.11.2, Not Yet Released
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Previously `clear_mem` was implemented by an inlined call to
  `std::memset`. However an optimizing compiler might notice cases
  where the memset could be skipped in cases allowed by the standard.
  Now `clear_mem` calls `zero_mem` which is compiled separately and
  which zeros out the array through a volatile pointer. It is possible
  some compiler with some optimization setting (especially with
  something like LTO) might still skip the writes. It would be nice if
  there was an automated way to test this.

* The API of `Credentials_Manager::trusted_certificate_authorities`
  has changed to return a vector of `Certificate_Store*` instead of
  `X509_Certificate`. This allows the list of trusted CAs to be
  more easily updated dynamically or loaded lazily.

* A bug in the release script caused the `botan_version.py` included
  in :doc:`1.11.1 <1_11_1>` to be invalid, which required a manual
  edit to fix (:pr:`226`)

* The `asn1_int.h` header was split into `asn1_alt_name.h`,
  `asn1_attribute.h` and `asn1_time.h`.
