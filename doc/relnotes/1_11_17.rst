Version 1.11.17, 2015-06-18
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* All support for the insecure RC4 stream cipher has been removed
  from the TLS implementation.

* Fix decoding of TLS maximum fragment length. Regardless of what
  value was actually negotiated, TLS would treat it as a negotiated
  limit of 4096.

* Fix the configure.py flag `--disable-aes-ni` which did nothing of
  the sort.

* Fixed nmake clean target. GitHub #104

* Correct buffering logic in `Compression_Filter`. GitHub #93 and #95
