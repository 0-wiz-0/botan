Version 1.11.1, Not Yet Released
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new function :cpp:func:`Public_Key::estimated_strength` returns
an estimate for the upper bound of the strength of the key. For
instance for an RSA key, it will return an estimate of how many
operations GNFS would take to factor the key.

A new :cpp:class:`Path_Validation_Result` code has been added
``SIGNATURE_METHOD_TOO_WEAK``. By default signatures created with keys
below 80 bits of strength (as estimated by ``estimated_strength``) are
rejected. This level can be modified using a parameter to the
:cpp:class:`Path_Validation_Restrictions` constructor.
