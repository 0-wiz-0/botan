Version 1.11.15, 2015-03-08
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Support for RC4 in TLS, already disabled by default, is now deprecated.
  The RC4 ciphersuites will be removed entirely in a future release.

* A bug in ffi.cpp meant Python could only encrypt. Github issue 53.

* When comparing two ASN.1 algorithm identifiers, consider empty and
  NULL parameters the same.

* Fixed memory leaks in TLS and cipher modes introduced in 1.11.14

* MARK-4 failed when OpenSSL was enabled in the build in 1.11.14
  because the OpenSSL version ignored the skip parameter.

* Fix compilation problem on OS X/clang

* Use BOTAN_NOEXCEPT macro to work around lack of noexcept in VS 2013
