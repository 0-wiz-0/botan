Version 1.11.8, Not Yet Released
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The antique PBES1 private key encryption scheme (which only supports
  DES or 64-bit RC2) has been removed.

* Skein did not reset its internal state properly if clear() was
  called, causing it to produce incorrect results for the following
  message. It was reset correctly in final() so most usages should not
  be affected.
