Version 1.10.8, 2014-04-10
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fix a bug in primality testing introduced in 1.8.3 which caused only
  a single random base, rather than a sequence of random bases, to be
  used in the Miller-Rabin test. This increased the probability that a
  non-prime would be accepted, for instance a 1024 bit number would be
  incorrectly classed as prime with probability around 2^-40. Reported
  by Jeff Marrison.

* The key length limit on HMAC has been raised to 512 bytes, allowing
  the use of very long passphrases with PBKDF2.
