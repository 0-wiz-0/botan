Version 1.9.4, 2010-03-09
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Add the Ajisai SSLv3/TLSv1.0 implementation

* Add GOST 34.10-2001 public key signature scheme
* Add SIMD implementation of Noekeon

* Add SSE2 implementation of IDEA

* Extend Salsa20 to support longer IVs (XSalsa20)

* Perform XTS encryption and decryption in parallel where possible

* Perform CBC decryption in parallel where possible

* Add SQLite3 db encryption codec, contributed by Olivier de Gaalon

* Add a block cipher cascade construction

* Add support for password hashing for authentication (passhash9.h)

* Add support for Win32 high resolution system timers

* Major refactoring and API changes in the public key code

* PK_Signer class now verifies all signatures before releasing them to
  the caller; this should help prevent a wide variety of fault
  attacks, though it does have the downside of hurting signature
  performance, particularly for DSA/ECDSA.

* Changed S2K interface: derive_key now takes salt, iteration count

* Remove dependency on TR1 shared_ptr in ECC and CVC code

* Renamed ECKAEG to its more usual name, ECDH

* Fix crash in GMP_Engine if library is shutdown and reinitialized

* Fix an invalid memory read in MD4

* Fix Visual C++ static builds

* Remove Timer class entirely

* Switch default PKCS #8 encryption algorithm from 3DES to AES-128

* New configuration option, ``--gen-amalgamation``, creates a pair of
  files (``botan_all.cpp`` and ``botan_all.h``) which contain the
  contents of the library as it would have normally been compiled
  based on the set configuration.

* Many headers are now explicitly internal-use-only and are not installed

* Greatly improve the Win32 installer

* Several fixes for Visual C++ debug builds
