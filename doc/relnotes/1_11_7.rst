Version 1.11.7, Not Yet Released
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Botan's basic numeric types are now defined in terms of the
  C99/C++11 standard integer types. For instance `u32bit` is now a
  typedef for `uint32_t`, and both names are included in the
  namespace.

* There are now two executable outputs of the build, `botan-test`,
  which runs some or all of the tests, and `botan` which is used as a
  driver to call into various subcommands which can also act as
  examples of library use, much in the manner of the `openssl`
  command. It understands the commands `base64`, `asn1`, `x509`,
  `tls_client`, `tls_server`, `bcrypt`, `keygen`, `speed`, and various
  others. As part of this change many obsolete, duplicated, or one-off
  examples were removed, while others were extended with new
  functionality. Contributions of new subcommands, new bling for
  exising ones, or documentation in any form is welcome.

* Fix a bug in Lion, which was broken by a change in 1.11.0. The
  problem was not noticed before as Lion was also missing a test vector
  in previous releases.
