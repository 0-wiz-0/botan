Version 1.11.7, Not Yet Released
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The test program is now named `botan` and is also used as a driver
  to call into various subcommands which can also act as examples of
  library useful, much in the manner of the `openssl` command. It
  understands commands such as `version`, `asn1`, `x509`, `bcrypt`,
  `keygen`, `speed`, `test`, and various others. As part of this
  change many obsolete, duplicated, or one-off test examples were
  removed, while others were extended with new functionality.
  Contributions of new subcommands or new functions in exising ones
  are welcome.

* The internal directory structure has changed. Now all sources that
  are built into libbotan are in the new directory `lib`, with `src`
  containing all other sources such as the command line tool and build
  scripts.
