Version 1.11.11, Not Yet Released
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The Sqlite3 wrapper has been abstracted to a simple interface for
  SQL dbs in general, though Sqlite3 remains the only implementation.
  The main logic of the TLS session manager which stored encrypted
  sessions to a Sqlite3 database (`TLS::Session_Manager_SQLite`) has
  been moved to the new `TLS::Session_Manager_SQL`. The Sqlite3
  manager API remains the same but now just subclasses
  `TLS::Session_Manager_SQL` and has a constructor instantiate the
  concrete database instance.

  Applications which would like to use a different db can now do so
  without having to reimplement the session cache logic simply by
  implementing a database wrapper subtype.
