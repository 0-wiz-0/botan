Version 1.11.9, Not Yet Released
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * Fix a bug in certificate path validation which prevented successful
   validation if intermediate certificates were presented out of order.

 * Fix a bug introduced in 1.11.5 which could cause crashes or other
   incorrect behavior when a cipher mode filter was followed in the
   pipe by another filter, and that filter had a non-empty start_msg.
