Version 1.11.9, Not Yet Released
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * Fixed a bug in OCSP response decoding which would cause an error
   when attempting to decode responses from some widely used
   responders.

 * An implementation of HMAC_DRBG RNG from NIST SP800-90A has been
   added. Like the X9.31 PRNG implementation, it uses another
   underlying RNG for seeding material.

 * An implementation of the RFC 6979 deterministic nonce generator has
   been added.

 * Fix a bug in certificate path validation which prevented successful
   validation if intermediate certificates were presented out of order.

 * Fix a bug introduced in 1.11.5 which could cause crashes or other
   incorrect behavior when a cipher mode filter was followed in the
   pipe by another filter, and that filter had a non-empty start_msg.

 * The types.h header now uses stdint.h rather than cstdint to avoid
   problems with Clang on OS X.
