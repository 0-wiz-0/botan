Version 1.11.16, Not Yet Released
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* TLS has changed from using the non-standard and now deprecated NPN extension
  to the standard ALPN extension for negotiating an application-level protocol.
  Unfortunately the semantics of the exchange have changed with ALPN. Using
  NPN, the server offered a list of protocols it advertised, and then the
  client chose its favorite. With ALPN the client offers a list of protocols
  and the server chooses. Thus the signatures of both the TLS::Client and
  TLS::Server constructors have changed.

* Optimized ECDSA signature verification thanks to an observation by
  Dr. Falko Strenzke. On some systems verifications are between 1.5
  and 2 times faster than in 1.11.15.

* Fixed Python cipher update_granularity() and default_nonce_length()
  functions

* The library now builds on Visual C++ 2013
