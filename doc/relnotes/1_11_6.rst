Version 1.11.6, Not Yet Released
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The Boost filesystem and asio libraries are now being used
  internally. Using Boost is enabled by default, pass
  ``--without-boost`` to ``configure.py`` to disable.

* The default TLS policy no longer includes RC4 in the cipher list, and
  refuses to negotation SSLv3 by default.

* OAEP had two bugs, one of which allowed it to be used even if the
  key was too small, and the other of which would cause a crash during
  decryption if the EME data was too large for the associated key.

* GCM mode now uses the Intel clmul instruction when available

* Add Threefish-512, including an implementation using AVX2

* Add HKDF from :rfc:`5869`

* Add SIV from :rfc:`5297`

* TLS::Session_Manager_In_Memory's constructor now requires a RNG
