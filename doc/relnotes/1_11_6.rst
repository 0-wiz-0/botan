Version 1.11.6, Not Yet Released
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* OAEP had two bugs, one of which allowed it to be used even if the
  key was too small, and the other of which would cause a crash during
  decoding if the input was too large to have been created for the
  associated key.

 * Botan now requires Boost, specifically the filesystem and asio libraries.

 * The default TLS policy no longer includes RC4 in the cipher list, and
   refuses to negotation SSLv3 by default.

 * Add HKDF from :rfc:`5869`

 * Add SIV from :rfc:`5297`

 * TLS::Session_Manager_In_Memory now requires a rng to be passed to its
   constructor.
