* The Boost filesystem and asio libraries are now being used by default.
  Pass ``--without-boost`` to ``configure.py`` to disable.

* The default TLS policy no longer allows SSLv3 or RC4.

* OAEP had two bugs, one of which allowed it to be used even if the
  key was too small, and the other of which would cause a crash during
  decryption if the EME data was too large for the associated key.

* GCM mode now uses the Intel clmul instruction when available

* Add the Threefish-512 tweakable block cipher, including an AVX2 version

* Add SIV (from :rfc:`5297`) as a nonce-based AEAD

* Add HKDF (from :rfc:`5869`) using an experimental PRF interface

* Add HTTP utility functions and OCSP online checking

* Add TLS::Policy::acceptable_ciphersuite hook to disable ciphersuites
  on an ad-hoc basis.
