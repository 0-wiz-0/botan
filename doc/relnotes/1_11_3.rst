Version 1.11.3, Not Yet Released
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* A new TLS policy mechanism
  :cpp:func:`TLS::Policy::server_uses_own_ciphersuite_preferences`
  controls how a server chooses a ciphersuite. Previously it always
  chose its most preferred cipher out of the client's list, but this
  can allow configuring a server to choose by the client's preferences
  instead.

* Implementations of the OCB and GCM authenticated cipher modes are
  now included

* New functions for symmetric encryption are included in cryptobox.h

* A new function :cpp:func:`algorithm_kat_detailed` returns a string
  providing information about failures, instead of just a pass/fail
  indicator as in :cpp:func:`algorithm_kat`.
