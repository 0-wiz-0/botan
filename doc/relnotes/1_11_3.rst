Version 1.11.3, Not Yet Released
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Implementations of the OCB and GCM authenticated cipher modes are
  now included

* :cpp:class:`Keyed_Filter` now supports returning a
  :cpp:class:`Key_Length_Specification` so the full details of what
  keylengths are supported is now available in keyed filters.

* The experimental and rarely used Turing and WiderWAKE stream ciphers
  have been removed

* New functions for symmetric encryption are included in cryptobox.h

* A new function :cpp:func:`algorithm_kat_detailed` returns a string
  providing information about failures, instead of just a pass/fail
  indicator as in :cpp:func:`algorithm_kat`.
