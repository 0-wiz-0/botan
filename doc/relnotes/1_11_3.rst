Version 1.11.3, 2013-04-11
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Add a new interface for AEAD modes (:cpp:class:`AEAD_Mode`).

* Implementations of the OCB and GCM authenticated cipher modes are
  now included.

* Support for TLS GCM ciphersuites is now available.

* A new TLS policy mechanism
  :cpp:func:`TLS::Policy::server_uses_own_ciphersuite_preferences`
  controls how a server chooses a ciphersuite. Previously it always
  chose its most preferred cipher out of the client's list, but this
  can allow configuring a server to choose by the client's preferences
  instead.

* :cpp:class:`Keyed_Filter` now supports returning a
  :cpp:class:`Key_Length_Specification` so the full details of what
  keylengths are supported is now available in keyed filters.

* The experimental and rarely used Turing and WiderWAKE stream ciphers
  have been removed

* New functions for symmetric encryption are included in cryptobox.h
  though interfaces and formats are subject to change.

* A new function :cpp:func:`algorithm_kat_detailed` returns a string
  providing information about failures, instead of just a pass/fail
  indicator as in :cpp:func:`algorithm_kat`.
