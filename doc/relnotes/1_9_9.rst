Version 1.9.9, 2010-06-28
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new pure virtual function has been added to ``Filter``, ``name``
which simply returns some useful identifier for the object. Any
out-of-tree ``Filter`` implementations will need to be updated.

Add ``Keyed_Filter::valid_iv_length`` which makes it possible to query
as to what IV length(s) a particular filter allows. Previously,
partially because there was no such query mechanism, if a filter did
not support IVs at all, then calls to ``set_iv`` would be silently
ignored. Now an exception about the invalid IV length will be thrown.

The default iteration count for the password based encryption schemes
has been increased from 2048 to 10000. This should make
password-guessing attacks against private keys encrypted with versions
after this release somewhat harder.

New functions for encoding public and private keys to binary,
``X509::BER_encode`` and ``PKCS8::BER_encode`` have been added.

Problems compiling under Apple's version of GCC 4.2.1 and on 64-bit
MIPS systems using GCC 4.4 or later were fixed.

The coverage of Doxygen documentation comments has significantly
improved in this release.
