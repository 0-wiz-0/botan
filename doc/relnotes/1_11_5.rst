Version 1.11.5, Not Yet Released
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The interface previously exposed by AEAD modes which allows in-place
  processing of messages is now used by all cipher modes. An adaptor
  filter allows them to be used in a pipe.

* Optimized computation of XTS tweaks, producing a substantial speedup

* TLS channels now support sending a ``std::vector``

* Add a generic 64-bit multiply instruction for producing a 128 bit result
  in mul128.h

* Avoid potentially undefined operations in the bit rotation operations.  Not
  known to have caused problems under existing compilers but might break in the
  future. Found by Clang sanitizer, reported by Jeffrey Walton.
