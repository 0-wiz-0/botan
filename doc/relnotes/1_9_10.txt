Version 1.9.10, 2010-08-12
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Add a constant-time AES implementation using SSSE3. This code is
  based on public domain assembly written by `Mike Hamburg
  <http://crypto.stanford.edu/vpaes/>`_, and described in his CHES
  2009 paper "Accelerating AES with Vector Permute Instructions". In
  addition to being constant time, it is also significantly faster
  than the table-based implementation on some processors. The current
  code has been tested with GCC 4.5, Visual C++ 2008, and Clang 2.8.


* Support for dynamically loading Engine objects at runtime was also
  added. Currently only system that use ``dlopen``-style dynamic
  linking are supported.

* On GCC 4.3 and later, use the byteswap intrinsic functions.

* Drop support for building with Python 2.4

* Fix benchmarking of block ciphers in ECB mode

* Consolidate the two x86 assembly engines

* Rename S2K to PBKDF
