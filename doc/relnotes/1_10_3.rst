Version 1.10.3, 2012-07-10
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A change in 1.10.2 accidentally broke ABI compatibility with 1.10.1
and earlier versions, causing programs compiled against 1.10.1 to
crash if linked with 1.10.2 at runtime.

Recent versions of OpenSSL include extra information in ECC private
keys, the presence of which caused an exception when such a key was
loaded by botan. The decoding of ECC private keys has been changed to
ignore these fields if they are set.
