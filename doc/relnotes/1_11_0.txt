Version 1.11.0, Not Yet Released
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The codebase has converted to C++11. Currently GCC 4.7 and Clang 3.1
  are known to work.

* The MemoryVector and SecureVector container types have been removed.
  An alias of std::vector using an allocator that clears memory named
  secure_vector is used for key material, and std::vector is used for
  everything else.

* The method of mlocking memory is much improved, and if the process
  can mlock memory then it will be used automatically.

* The TLS interface is now non-blocking and does not directly interact
  with sockets. An example TLS server using asio is included which
  scales to at least 64 processors.

* X509_Store has been removed. x509_path_validate in x509path.h now
  handles path validation and Certificate_Store handles storage of
  certificates and CRLs.

* Add support for OCSP

* TLS v1.2 is now supported

* TLS now supports session resumption. Session information can be
  saved in memory or to an encrypted SQLite database.

* TLS renegotiation is now supported

* TLS client authentication is now supported

* TLS SRP and PSK ciphersuites are now supported

* TLS session tickets are now supported

* TLS ECDH key exchange and ECDSA certificates are now supported

* Add support for SHA-2 ciphersuites

* Add support for anonymous DH/ECDH ciphersuites
