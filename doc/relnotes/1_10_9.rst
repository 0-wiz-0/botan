Version 1.10.9, 2014-12-13
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fixed EAX tag verification to run in constant time

* The default TLS policy now disables SSLv3.

* A crash could occur when reading from a blocking random device if
  the device initially indicated that entropy was available but
  a concurrent process drained the entropy pool before the
  read was initiated.

* Fix decoding indefinite length BER constructs that contain a context
  sensitive tag of zero. Github pull 26 from Janusz Chorko.

* The `botan-config` script previously tried to guess its prefix from
  the location of the binary. However this was error prone, and now
  the script assumes the final installation prefix matches the value
  set during the build. Github issue 29.
