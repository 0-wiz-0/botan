Recommended Algorithms
---------------------------------

This section is by no means the last word on selecting which
algorithms to use.  However, botan includes a sometimes bewildering
array of possible algorithms, and unless you're familiar with the
latest developments in the field, it can be hard to know what is
secure and what is not. The following attributes of the algorithms
were evaluated when making this list: security, standardization,
patent status, support by other implementations, and efficiency (in
roughly that order).

It is intended as a set of simple guidelines for developers, and
nothing more.  It's entirely possible that there are algorithms that
will turn out to be more secure than the ones listed, but the
algorithms listed here are (currently) thought to be safe.

* Block ciphers: AES or Serpent in CBC, CTR, or XTS mode

* Hash functions: SHA-256, SHA-512

* MACs: HMAC with any recommended hash function

* Public Key Encryption: RSA with "EME1(SHA-256)"

* Public Key Signatures: RSA with EMSA4 and any recommended hash, or
  DSA or ECDSA with "EMSA1(SHA-256)"

* Key Agreement: Diffie-Hellman or ECDH, with "KDF2(SHA-256)"

Algorithms Listing
----------------------------------------

Botan includes a very sizable number of cryptographic algorithms. In
nearly all cases, you never need to know the header file or type name
to use them. However, you do need to know what string (or strings) are
used to identify that algorithm. These names conform to those set out
by SCAN (Standard Cryptographic Algorithm Naming), which is a document
that specifies how strings are mapped onto algorithm objects, which is
useful for a wide variety of crypto APIs (SCAN is oriented towards
Java, but Botan and several other non-Java libraries also make at
least some use of it). For full details, read the `SCAN document
<http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/hopwood/crypto/scan/>`_.

Many of these algorithms can take options (such as the number of
rounds in a block cipher, the output size of a hash function,
etc). These are shown in the following list; all of them default to
reasonable values. There are algorithm-specific limits on most of
them. When you see something like "HASH" or "BLOCK", that means
you should insert the name of some algorithm of that type. There are
no defaults for those options.

A few very obscure algorithms are skipped; if you need one of them,
you'll know it, and you can look in the appropriate header to see what
that classes' ``name`` function returns (the names tend to
match that in SCAN, if it's defined there).

 - ROUNDS: The number of rounds in a block cipher.
 - OUTSZ: The output size of a hash function or MAC
