Accessing Version Control
----------------------------------------

Botan's development occurs using a distributed version control system
called `Monotone <http://www.monotone.ca>`_. The main branch of
development occurs on the branch named ``net.randombit.botan``. To
download that branch and set up a new workspace, run::

   $ mtn db init --db=botan.mtn
   $ mtn pull --db=botan.mtn randombit.net 'net.randombit.botan'
   [...]
   $ mtn checkout --db=botan.mtn --branch=net.randombit.botan
   [...]

By default the ``checkout`` command will place the workspace in a
directory with the same name as the branch you are checking out. If
you want a different directory name, just include it after the
``--branch`` option (you can also rename this directory at any time).

If this is the first time you've connected to the server, Monotone
will print::

  mtn: first time connecting to server randombit.net
  mtn: I'll assume it's really them, but you might want to double-check
  mtn: their key's fingerprint: 8c0b868f2247215c63c96983b1c8ca0f0f0cfd9a

The fingerprint shown above was the correct one as of June 20, 2012.

To pull further changes, from anywhere in the workspace run these
commands::

  $ mtn pull
  [...]
  $ mtn update
  [summary of changes]

The ``mtn update`` command will give you a summary of which files
changed; to view the full changelog, run ``mtn log``.
