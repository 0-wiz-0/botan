========================================

It's a very good idea if you have some knowledge of cryptography
*before* trying to use the library. This is an area where it is very
easy to make mistakes, and where things are often subtle and/or
counterintuitive. Obviously the library tries to provide things at a
high level precisely to minimize the number of ways things can go
wrong, but naive use will almost certainly not result in a secure
system.

Especially recommended are:

- *Cryptography Engineering*
  by Niels Ferguson, Bruce Schneier, and Tadayoshi Kohno

- *Security Engineering -- A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems*
  by Ross Anderson

- *Handbook of Applied Cryptography*
  by Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. Van Oorschot, and Scott A. Vanstone
