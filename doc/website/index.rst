Welcome
========================================

Botan is a crypto library for C++ released under the permissive
:doc:`BSD-2 license <license>`.

It provides useful things like TLS, X.509 PKIX (certs, CRLs, OCSP,
etc), ECDSA, AES, GCM, and bcrypt, plus a :doc:`kitchen sink <algos>`
of other crypto algorithms of various utility. A third party open source
implementation of `SSHv2 <http://www.netsieben.com/products/ssh/>`_
that uses botan is also available. In addition to C++ you can use
(parts of) botan from Python or Perl (both included in tree), or with
`Node.js <https://github.com/justinfreitag/node-botan>`_.

See the :doc:`faq` for a list of common questions and answers,
:doc:`download` for information about getting the latest release,
and :doc:`manual` for the documentation.
